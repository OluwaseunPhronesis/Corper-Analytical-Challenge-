## Data Gathering and Transformation
The data was gotten from Kaggle .com which are (Restaurant and Order Data) and it was accomplished by Adewale Yusuf.

The Order data has 5,010 records: 10Columns and 5,010Rows.  The data includes Order ID, Customer Name, Restaurant ID, Order Date, Quantity of items, Order Amount, Payment Mode, Delivery Time Taken, Customer Rating-Food, Customer Rating-Delivery which will allow me to properly visualize and dimension the data.

The Restaurants Data is a small table that has a primary key (Restaurant ID) that I used to connect to the Order Data. It has 147 data records: 7Columns and 21 Rows. The data includes Restaurant ID (Primary Key), Restaurant Name, Cuisine, Zone, Category, State and Target.

The two data were connected using Power Pivot (File-Option-Add ins- Com add ins-Power Pivot), click on manage-Data sources -Excel file- browse- check use first row as column headers.

From data source -Excel file- browser â€“ Restaurant data- use first row as headers- Restaurant Details.

Diagram view and link them together and save in power pivot.

After connecting the data, I proceed into building my report and Dashboard.
